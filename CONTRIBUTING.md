# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're looking for people interested in the vision of Eclaire and willing to help. Have a look at the [Roadmap](README.md#roadmap), [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclaire-labs/eclaire/issues), or feel free to suggest features or fixes. There are areas for improvement across the whole stack. We're also open to integrating or partnering with other open source projects that are building pieces that can augment, complement, or replace some of the existing building blocks in Eclaire.

## Code Style

- Run `npm run format` to format your code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Write descriptive commit messages

## Testing

- Add or update tests when introducing new features or bug fixes
- Ensure all existing tests pass locally
- Run the full suite with `npm test`

## Pull Request Process

1. Keep PRs focused on a single concern
2. Provide a clear description of your changes
3. Reference any related issues
4. Make sure all checks pass (formatting, tests, CI)
5. Request a review from maintainers

_Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and merge._

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- Choose the appropriate issue template
- Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, logs, etc.)
- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates
